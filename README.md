## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am Jamiu Olamilekan Badmus. I am deeply curious about how policy-relevant research shapes evidence-based decision-making. My research interests lie at the intersection of international trade, trade policy analysis, geoeconomics, and development economics using quantitative methods and causal inference.

I recently graduated from the Erasmus Mundus Master’s in Economics of Globalization and European Integration (EGEI) program, funded by the European Commission from 2023 to 2025. Previously, I completed bachelor's and master's degrees in Economics from Tai Solarin University of Education, Nigeria.

I am currently completing a predoctoral Certificate Program in Economic Theory, Econometrics, and Mathematical Economics (CETEME) at the BAUM Tenpers Research Institute in Arlington, Virginia, where I am strengthening my proof-based mathematical and statistical skills for advanced structural and causal modeling applications in economic theory and econometrics in preparation for admission into a PhD program in Economics by Fall 2026.

I use my GitHub to document:
- 📦 Replication packages for some structural gravity papers (usually translated from Stata to R); 
- 💾 Replication packages for some of my published papers;
